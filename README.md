# My personal setup for vimfiles

Start by cloning the repository

```console
git clone https://github.com/halexsrv/nvim ~/.config/nvim
```

Open vim and install packages pressing "leader rv", close and open vim again

Leader key is mapping in ","

If tmux not showing 256 color run command below

```console
echo 'set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"' > ~/.tmux.conf
```
